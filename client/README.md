# 📊 TRIAGE-X: Observability NOC Dashboard
**"Real-time visual telemetry for Autonomous SRE Agents."**

This is the frontend component of the TRIAGE-X benchmark. It provides a minimalist, high-performance Network Operations Center (NOC) interface to visualize agent actions, system health cascades, and alert statuses.

## 🚀 Features
*   **Live Telemetry:** Real-time visualization of `system_health` and `customer_impact` metrics.
*   **Service Topology:** Visual map of active microservices (API Gateway, DB, Payment, etc.) and their health states.
*   **Action Log:** History of actions taken by the AI agent (e.g. `restart_service`, `throttle_queue`).
*   **Alert Feed:** Stream of active system alerts (Simulated CloudWatch/Datadog logs).
